Hi there, 
from last few days i was trying to make a repository. actuall i'm fully new to to create git repository. finally i make this repository. i think you notice that i make some spelling mistake on file name and final commit feild.
but if you check the main project file, you see there in no complication and no error, although the final commit have a spelling mistake.
By the way this code will help you covert any temperature celsius to fahrenheit, fahrenheit to celsius.
